the_builder_fix
===============

This is a Wordpress-Childtheme for fixing "The Builder" Wordpress Theme from http://www.webinpixels.com/ After updating the WooCommerce to 2.0.x the parent theme stops working â€“ this Child-Theme tries to fix some of these issues.

Install the theme, activate it, maybe reassign menues and you're ready to go. If it is not working for you, just switch back to the original theme. If you're a developer feel free to fix more stuff and merge it back here, for all of us :-)

SO FAR IT'S JUST A ROUGH & UNTESTED TRY TO FIX THINGS, NOTHING IS GUARANTEED! It should not be able to do any harm, BUT USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!
